# Vercel & Deployments

- This app is deployed on **Vercel** from the **`turnset-clean`** GitHub repo.
- Vercel handles:
  - Production deploys from the main branch.
  - Preview deployments for feature branches/PRs.

Guidelines:

- Ensure the app **builds cleanly** on Vercel:
  - No unguarded env var usage (handle missing vars gracefully in development).
- Environment variables:
  - Set Shopify and Sanity env vars in Vercel Project settings for:
    - Production
    - Preview (if needed)
- No custom CI/CD deploy steps are required:
  - GitHub Actions should focus on:
    - `lint`
    - `test`
    - `type-check`
  - Vercel will perform the actual deploy on successful pushes.

# UI Style & Tailwind

- Use **Tailwind CSS** as the primary styling system.
- Aim for:
  - Clean, modern, minimal SaaS-style design.
  - Good spacing, clear hierarchy, readable typography.
  - Fully responsive layouts (mobile → desktop).
- If using shadcn/ui:
  - Keep component usage minimal and consistent.
  - Prefer composable primitives (e.g. Card, Button) over deeply nested custom components.

## UX & Layout

- Use semantic HTML where possible:
  - `<main>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`.
- For key pages:
  - Homepage: make the hero clear, with a strong CTA.
  - Services listing: scannable cards, clear price, short description.
  - Service detail: good structure for sections (what’s included, FAQ, etc.).
- Use `next/image` for images to improve performance and caching.

### Design Principles

We follow these key principles:

- Usability: Clear navigation, consistent button styles, and straightforward forms.
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and color contrast.
- Responsiveness: Mobile-first design that adapts layouts from phones to desktops.
- Clarity: Simple language, clear calls to action, and minimal clutter.

### Styling and Theming

Tailwind CSS is our core styling tool with a light/dark theme toggle. We follow a consistent color palette:

Light mode:

- Primary: #6366F1, Secondary: #06B6D4, CTA: #4F46E5
- Backgrounds: #F5F7FB / #FFFFFF, Borders: #E2E8F0, Text: #0B1220
- Alerts: Success #16A34A, Warning #F59E0B, Error #DC2626

Dark mode:

- Primary: #818CF8, Secondary: #22D3EE, CTA: #6366F1
- Backgrounds: #0B1220 / #0F172A, Borders: #1F2937, Text: #E5E7EB
- Alerts: Success #22C55E, Warning #FBBF24, Error #F87171

We use utility classes for spacing, typography, and layout. Fonts are system-UI for performance and familiarity.

- When customizing colors, first create the color variable in the css file, `src/styles/globals.css`, similar to this

  ```css
  :root {
    --color-primary: #6366F1;
  }
  ```

  - Then use the color variable in the tailwind `@theme` statement, similar to this
  
  ```css
  @theme {
    --color-primary: var(--color-primary);
  }
  ```

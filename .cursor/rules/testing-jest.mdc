# Testing with Jest

- Use **Jest** with **React Testing Library** for unit/integration tests on:
  - Components in `components/`
  - Utility functions in `lib/`
- Prefer tests for:
  - Critical rendering logic (e.g., service listing, service detail)
  - Data transformation helpers (mapping Shopify/Sanity responses to internal types)
- General guidelines:
  - Keep tests fast and focused.
  - Name test files alongside code when reasonable: `ComponentName.test.tsx`.
  - Use Testing Library best practices:
    - Query by role/text/label instead of test IDs when possible.
- It’s okay to start with a small test surface:
  - e.g., test the homepage rendering and one key helper.

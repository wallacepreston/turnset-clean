# Code Style & Editing

- Use **TypeScript** everywhere (`.ts` / `.tsx`), no `.js` files.
- Prefer **functional React components** and **hooks**.
- Keep components small and focused; extract shared UI into `components/`.
- Organize non-UI logic into `lib/` (Shopify client, Sanity client, helpers).
- When editing:
  - Prefer **refactors** that keep behavior unchanged unless explicitly asked.
  - Keep diffs minimal and focused on the user’s request.
- Naming:
  - Components: `PascalCase`
  - Hooks & functions: `camelCase`
  - Types & interfaces: `PascalCase`
- Enable and respect ESLint/Prettier formatting:
  - Do not introduce new lint warnings where possible.
  - If a rule is clearly too strict for this codebase, leave a comment for the user rather than auto-disabling it everywhere.
